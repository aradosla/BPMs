# BPMs data analysis MD9407

- This is a small repository, concerning the 10 Hz data analysis. It contains one simple example of reading the data and extracting basic properties.
- The file used for reading is: Beam1@Turn@2023_06_17@01_49_09_307.sdds. It is larger than 25 MB, thus it cannot be uploaded to github. I use Swan for running the notebook as I can access the data easily.
