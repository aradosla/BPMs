# BPMs data analysis MD9407

## Data analysis

- This is a small repository, concerning the 10 Hz data analysis. It contains one simple example of reading the data and extracting basic properties.
- The file used for reading is: ```Beam1@Turn@2023_06_17@01_49_09_307.sdds```. It is larger than 25 MB, thus it cannot be uploaded to github. I use Swan for running the notebook as I can access the data easily.
- The notebook in SWAN can be open and run here!: https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/FvtlsuN2A9DsN8e

## Simulations

- An example of the algorithm used for localization
- Simulations with XSuite
